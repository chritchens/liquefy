## Status

At the moment the client is at its infancy, but look back every once in awhile as there will be very rapid changes.

## Building

To build the code, run from the repository:

```sh
$ cargo build
```

Knows though, that at the moment there is nothing to be run.

```sh
$ cargo doc --open
```

to have the documentation open in your browser.
